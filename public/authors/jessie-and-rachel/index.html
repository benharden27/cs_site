<h2>Bio</h2>



<p><em>“Overall, our favorite part of this process was talking with our interviewees. Both Glen and Mark had such interesting perspectives on the partnership, as well as on the human role in learning about and caring for the oceans. A challenge we faced was “murdering our darlings” as we wrote the script. Often, we’d get attached to ideas or quotes that we had our hearts set on including, and cutting them out of the final script was so difficult. Our biggest takeaways were learning more about the science behind ocean heat waves, which neither of us knew about before embarking on this, and even more so than that, learning everything that goes into producing a 5 minutes podcast."</em></p>
