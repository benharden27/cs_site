<h2>Bio</h2>



<p><em>“We enjoyed interviewing the most out of all the tasks. Connecting with our interview subject like that was incredibly rewarding and fun and got us out of our comfort zone. Also, we learned a lot from her and felt incredibly connected to the scientific community. The most challenging part was the audio organization. Going through all the quotes and picking the best ones was also a challenge because we got so many strong ones that would have added to the story immensely. Out of this experience, we were able to get passionate about something we otherwise would not have learned about and it has led us to continue research about the subject. Overall, we developed an intense love and compassion towards the North Atlantic Right Whale.”</em></p>
