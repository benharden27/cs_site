      <description>On the southern shore of Cape Cod you can find beautiful, bright green marshlands within Waquoit Bay. The marshes are homes for a vast array of plants and animals that rely on them to survive. Although, due to climate change their homes are being altered by storms, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification which leads to vegetation loss and a decline of various birds species. Some people may be unaware of the importance of marine marshes and how they are powerful natural ecosystems with potential to reduce climate change.</description>
