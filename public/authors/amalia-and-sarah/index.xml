      <description>The story of the Coonamessett river in Cape Cod could have been one of a group of humans dismantling a natural environment. In the last three centuries, the Coonamessett has been profoundly modified. First, by the creation of dams blocking the river done by the grist mill industry. Later, by the sanding of the river for growing cranberries.
