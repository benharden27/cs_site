### Stories of Environmental Change on Cape Cod

The following stories were produced by the Fall 2019 [SEA Semester](https://www.sea.edu) program, [Climate and Society](../about/).

As part of their *Environmental Communication* class during the shore component, student teams had just 6 weeks to report on a local environmental project on Cape Cod.
