[Climate and Society](https://www.sea.edu/voyages/climate_society_fall2019) is a 12-week [SEA Semester](https://www.sea.edu) program with a focus on the intersection of climate change with human society. Students spend the first six weeks of the program at SEA's campus in Woods Hole, MA before travelling to glacier country in New Zealand and eventially joining the [SSV Robert C. Seamans](https://www.sea.edu/ships_crew/seamans) for a 30-day expedition to explore the open ocean. These [stories](ec_stories/) are part of the "Environmental Communication" class during the first shore component in Woods Hole. 

Students were in teams of two to report on their assigned story around the Cape Cod region.
