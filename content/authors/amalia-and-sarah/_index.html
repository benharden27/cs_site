<p><em>“We enjoyed meeting Betsy Gladfelter, she was a great interviewee and inspiring to us. The whole process of producing the podcast was enjoyable. We had a good brainstorming stage, a great interview and a story that flowed naturally. Our biggest challenge was reducing a fantastic audio of several hours full of incredible details to a five-minute podcast. This experience gave us a better idea of what producing radio is like, an exercise for attempting to produce a story suitable for a non-scientific audience and a close-up to the different and complex steps that take place in a restoration process.”</em></p>
