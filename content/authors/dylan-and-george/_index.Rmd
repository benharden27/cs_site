*"This was a very rewarding project to work on. From tip to tail, interview to editing, we found it fun, interesting, and personal. Carla and Matthias were a joy to interview and it meant a lot that we felt we had made a genuine connection. Most of the groundwork was in writing the script, and it was a new experience that took a lot of collaboration. It was a fun and fulfilling way to get to know each other throughout the semester, and we’re proud of what we did. Black Inscription itself gets better and better every time we listen to it, and it’s a unique way to remember the project and our time at Woods Hole."*
