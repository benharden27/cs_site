*"Our team enjoyed learning about new ways to save the environment and reduce the impacts of climate change. It is inspiring to know how many passionate scientists have chosen to take action in the Cape Cod area by protecting marshlands instead of simply waiting for the public to react. We also enjoyed learning about the interviewing process, collecting sounds and footage, and editing the soundtracks and videos later. One of our challenges was adjusting to the meeting time changes with our interviewees; it was important to be flexible during the interview process and use time wisely. Finally, we believe that we learned the importance of teamwork during this experience as we both complemented our strengths and weaknesses."*
