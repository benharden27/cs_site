<p><em>“We came into this project with a set direction that we wanted our story to go in, but after a change in interview subject and learning more about the Municipal Shellfish Program, we reworked our story and found it to be much richer. Lots of parts of this process were new to us and we of course learned a lot about oysters and aquaculture on Cape Cod, as well as how to produce a podcast or radio segment. The most valuable part of this process for us, though, was the experience of trying to effectively communicate a project that was both social and scientific, to a wide audience in a concise and comprehensive way.”</em></p>
