<p><em>“We truly enjoyed learning how to operate the recording tools and heading over to WHOI to interview Jenny Rheuben. It was a joy working together, but that’s not to say that developing our story didn’t have a couple bumps in the road. Our original story excited us and we had set a distinct path that we’d like to follow, but the information we got from the interview lead us in a different direction. Some things we’ve gotten out of this experience is, an awesome podcast, practice with time management, and opened our minds to the possibility of creating some amazing podcasts in the future.”</em></p>
