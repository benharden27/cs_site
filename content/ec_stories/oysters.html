<p>Oysters are an icon of Cape Cod. Tourists flock here in the summer to find the best shellfish in town, enjoy evenings at oyster bars, and even try their hand at oyster picking themselves. But the Falmouth Municipal Shellfish Propagation Program is giving these small animals a whole new life here, growing them to both control pollution and bolster local aquaculture industry.</p>

<p>Falmouth’s nitrogen pollution problem is becoming worse as the population here grows. Nitrogen gets into waterways from septic system effluent and fertilizer and stormwater runoff, and high levels of Nitrogen in waterways cause phytoplankton and algal blooms, leading to unpleasant smells, murky water, loss of biodiversity, and even fish kills. Oysters can filter up to 50 gallons of water each per day and they feed on phytoplankton, making them an excellent nitrogen management tool. The Municipal Oyster Program uses oyster aquaculture to improve water quality of some of Falmouth’s most degraded estuarine ecosystems. Christina Lovely and her coworkers at Falmouth Marine and Environmental Services work with many volunteers to raise oysters, starting from seed in upwellers, and then in grow-out farm gear at field sites before moving them to the harbor for harvest.</p>

<p>This project is special because of the sheer number of benefits that it provides. The program is only a few years old, but residents have already seen drastic water quality improvements- homeowners at the Little Pond field site say that they can now see through water that was too murky to do so just a few years ago. The program also provides other benefits to the community, from educational experiences for local high schoolers to getting retired volunteers involved and invested in the issue.</p>
