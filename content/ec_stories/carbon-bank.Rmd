On the southern shore of Cape Cod you can find beautiful, bright green marshlands within Waquoit Bay. The marshes are homes for a vast array of plants and animals that rely on them to survive. Although, due to climate change their homes are being altered by storms, sea-level rise, and ocean acidification which leads to vegetation loss and a decline of various birds species. Some people may be unaware of the importance of marine marshes and how they are powerful natural ecosystems with potential to reduce climate change. They reduce carbon dioxide within the atmosphere by absorbing greenhouse gas emissions through photosynthesis. In fact, they have the ability to store blue carbon at rates three to five times greater than forests.

Although marshes alone will not be able to ultimately fix climate change, it is crucial to invest in marshlands as they are cost-efficient and sustainable tools that can achieve higher results in the long term than many other alternatives and technologies provided until today. Therefore, it is important to protect them sooner than later to receive better results in cutting down climate changeâ€™s negative impacts and having a safer environment for future generations.
