<p>This summer, fisherman on the cape encountered a surprising catch. Traps hauled aboard were full of lifeless lobsters. Upon further investigation, this die-off was attributed to changes in the ocean’s temperature, more specifically, an ocean heat wave.</p>

<p>But this is more than just a story about ocean heat waves. This is a story about the scientists who study them, the fishermen who deal with the consequences, and the extraordinary fleet that brought these two groups together.</p>
<p>Ocean heat waves are a marine phenomenon in which the water’s temperature is raised for a period of several days. Both the ecological and economic impacts of these heat waves can be felt, particularly in the waters off Cape Cod. Though surprisingly, there is still a lot of mystery behind them. Ocean temperature data has typically come from satellites, but as one could imagine, it’s hard to get data on what’s going on below the surface when the data collection point is up in space.</p>
<p>In a unique collaboration, New England’s scientists and fishermen teamed up to learn more about the impacts of changes in the ocean’s temperature. To do this, the two entities worked together to increase the amount of monitoring below the surface. In addition to a better understanding of the region’s waters, each came away understanding the value in not just leaving science up to the scientists.</p>
